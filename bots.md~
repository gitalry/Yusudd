 Bots are similar to worms and Trojans, but earn their unique name by performing a wide variety of automated tasks on behalf of their master (the cybercriminals) who are often safely located somewhere far across the Internet. Tasks that bots can perform run the gamut from sending spam to blasting Web sites off the Internet as part of a coordinated "denial-of-service" attack. Since a bot infected computer does the bidding of its master, many people refer to these victim machines as "zombies."
